# CrowdCart
Our project for HampHack 2017. It is a crowdsourced price-comparison engine for groceries and other common household items. Local prices can be uploaded by taking a picture of a shopping receipt. Then, users can enter their own shopping list and be given a computer-generated "optimal route" to purchase their groceries, which finds the best local prices to save them time and money.
